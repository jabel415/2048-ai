Random player works by pressing r once the gui of the game has started.

Make sure you install the following in order for everything to work:

Install Xcode from AppStore (if on a mac, just the command line tools
for Xcode works as well)
pip install pyobjc-core
pip install pyobjc-framework-Quartz
pip install image
pip install pyautogui
